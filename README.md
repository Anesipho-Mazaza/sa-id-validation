## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anesipho-Mazaza/sa-id-validation.git
cd sa-id-validation
````

### 2. Run Unit Tests

```bash
gradle test
```

### 3. Build the Project

```bash
gradle build
```

### 4. Run the App

**Important:** For interactive input, do **NOT** use `./gradlew run` or `./gradlew.bat :app:run`, as Gradle does not reliably support console input. Instead, run the app directly with Java after building:

```bash
java -cp app/build/classes/java/main sa_id_validation.App
```

### Example Output

```
Testing with ID: 9202205001082
The ID is valid!
DOB: 1992-02-20
Gender: Male
Citizenship: SA Citizen
Age: 33
```

If the ID is invalid, you will see an error message explaining why.
